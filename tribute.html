    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of SSR's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1986</strong> - Born in Bihar, INDIA</li>
      <li>
        <strong>2003</strong> - he had ranked seventh in the AIEEE Entrance Exam and secured admission in the Bachelor of Engineering (Mechanical Engineering) class in Delhi Technical University. He was also a National Olympiad Winner in Physics. In all, he cleared as many as 11 engineering entrance exams, including that for the Indian School of Mines. After he started participating in theatre and dance, he rarely had time for studies, resulting in several backlogs which ultimately made him leave DTU. He completed only three years of the four-year course before dropping out to pursue an acting career.
        While a student at Delhi Technological University, Rajput enrolled in Shiamak Davar's dance classes.It was only later that the idea of making a career in acting came to him, as some of his fellow students in the dance classes happened to be interested in acting and was attending Barry John's drama classes. Influenced by them, Rajput also joined the acting classes. Here, he found his passion for acting: "I found the experience liberating. I realised that I could communicate with the audience. I knew I wanted to do this forever.

Within a few months of joining the dance class, Rajput was selected to be a member of Davar's standard dance troupe
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2005</strong> -He was chosen to be one of the groups of background dancers at the 51st Filmfare Awards.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2006</strong> -  He was part of the troupe that went to Australia to perform in the cultural programme at the opening ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games. By this time, he was tired of engineering. He was happy and successful in the dance and drama classes and decided to do what he was good at. He dropped out of engineering and devoted himself full-time to dancing and acting.

To make a break into films, Rajput moved to Mumbai and joined Nadira Babbar's Ekjute theatre group, which he remained a part of for two and a half years.During this time, he was featured in a TV advertisement for Nestlé Munch, which became famous throughout India
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2008</strong> - The casting team of Balaji Telefilms saw Rajput's personality and acting talent while he was on stage for one of Ekjute's plays. They invited him to audition for them and Rajput landed the role of Preet Juneja in Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil. His character was killed quite early in the show, but he was such a popular character with the viewers that he was brought back for the series finale in the form of a spirit, looking on as his family celebrates after going through difficult times.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2009</strong> - Rajput began starring in Pavitra Rishta as Manav Deshmukh, a serious and mature character working as a mechanic to support his family. His work in this serial received wide appreciation, and Rajput received three major television awards for the best male actor and most popular actor. This performance was his breakthrough and gave him a stepping stone into films. Initially when producer Ekta Kapoor cast him as lead for Pavitra Rishta while playing the parallel lead in Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil, Zee TV did not accept him. However, Kapoor convinced them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2010</strong> - In May 2010, Rajput joined the dance reality show Zara Nachke Dikha 2. Rajput was a part of the Mast Kalandar Boys Team, which ultimately became the first runner up of the season.He shot for both Pavitra Rishta and Zara Nachke Dikha 2 at the same time. On the Mother's Day special episode, his team dedicated a performance to his mother, who had died in 2002.

In December 2010, Rajput participated in another dance-based reality show, Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 4, where he was paired with choreographer Shampa Sonthalia, for which he again became the first runner up of the season.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2011</strong> -In October 2011, Rajput decided to quit Pavitra Rishta to pursue a filmmaking course abroad, and in November 2011, Rajput quit the series and was replaced by Hiten Tejwani. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2013</strong> - Rajput auditioned for Abhishek Kapoor's Kai Po Che! and was selected to play one of the three leads, along with Rajkumar Rao and Amit Sadh. Based on the Chetan Bhagat novel The 3 Mistakes of My Life, the film proved to be a critical and commercial success. His portrayal of Ishaan Bhatt, an ex-district level cricketer who is a victim of politics in the cricketing selection fraternity, was praised. Critic Rajeev Masand wrote: "...it's Sushant Singh Rajput, making his film debut as Ishaan, who it's hard to take your eyes off. The actor has an indescribable presence and it's clear from his confidence and distinct likeability that a star is born."

His second movie was Shuddh Desi Romance, alongside Parineeti Chopra and Vaani Kapoor. Directed by Maneesh Sharma and produced by Yash Raj Films, the film deals with the subject of live-in relationships and was completely filmed in Jaipur, Rajasthan. Taran Adarsh from Bollywood Hungama praised Rajput's performance, saying: "After leaving a tremendous impression in his first Hindi outing, Sushant Singh Rajput... brings a lot of freshness with his unpretentious and spontaneous act. Sukanya Verma from Rediff stated: "After a dynamic debut in Kai Po Che!, Rajput channelises his abundant energy to convey the childlike ineptitude of a man who wears his heart on a sleeve.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>2014</strong> - Sushant's next role was in Rajkumar Hirani's 2014 film PK. Although his role was relatively minor, the film gave him the opportunity to work with Aamir Khan and Anushka Sharma. Upon its release, the film proved to be the one of the highest-grossing Indian films.

        We got to spend some quality time together during the shoot of Sonchiriya. He was not your usual hero. He was a science buff, I am one as well. We had lots to talk about that. he was into astro-physics, astronomy. He was an enthusiastic reader. He read on science, maths, self help books, non fiction.  I remember there was this big lunar event, I think the Red Moon. He had his telescope flown down to Chambal, set it up for us to enjoy that. He didn't seem to be the kind to take such a step as he did. He was so high on life and a great fitness freak. -- Ranvir Shorey<br>
